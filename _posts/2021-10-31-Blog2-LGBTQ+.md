### Background Information

Established in 2018, Queer Britain is the first national LGBTQ+ museum in the UK. It will be an essential place for all regardless of sexuality or gender identity, to find out about the culture they have been born into, have chosen or seek to understand. It will help complete the Nation’s family tree. To fulfill this aim, the museum will feature permanent and temporary exhibitions, including objects and records from the worlds of art, fashion, film, literature, TV, theatre, news, music, diaries, letters, photographs and legal records. There will also be video and audio interviews with queer people of all ages and backgrounds, activists, their friends, allies, families, observers and opponents.


### When and why was this archive created? 

This museum is established due to the historical background of queer people's stories being marginalised or even forgorten in the river of time. Queer people have impacted every part of culture, yet all too often their lives have been written in the margins of history books. Valuable stories and artefacts are being lost. Once gone, they may never be recovered. These deserve a dedicated space to be preserved, explored and celebrated.


### Where did the objects come from? Under what circumstances were they acquired?

The objects come from a wide range of sources in partnership with the Bank of English, DIVA magazine, business companies, research institutions, musuems, individuals etc.
	• For example, the Turing £50 will be released by the bank of England in memory of Alan Turing. The new £50 note features an image of the code-breaking gay scientist, Alan Turing. The discussion was led by Dr. Dominic Galliano, Head of Public Engagement from UCL, and features Sarah John, the Chief Cashier of the Bank of England; Josh Little, the lawyer who led the Allen & Overy team advising Stonewall on 2017's gross indecency 'Turing Law' pardons and the Quantum Scientist, Dr. Alex Moylett. The Bank of England made a special announcement during the event.


### Page Style 

The style of page layout is clear, bright and artistic. Adopting the contrasting colors of black and white as dominant background colors, visitors' attention can be easily led to the main content (i.e. the pictures, titles, and texts). The contrasting colors are also leveraged to divide different themes into blocks, with black as the lowest layer while white as the floating layer. By this, the structure of webpage is concisely presented to audiences. In addition, the juxtaposition of pictures and text boxes is visual-friendly in terms of space, consistancy and creativity. 

The interactive response of webpages is worth attention. When scrolling down the webpage, the main titles will appear in a 1 second delay, creating a sense of flexibility and high-tech. 

However, there is one point should be improved from my perspective. The font style should be consistant to make audience easier to read. 


### What third-party platforms are they using?

Google maps are embeded in the webpages to reveal the location of the museum/exhibition. Not only a direct link with the address name is provided, but also a block of zoom out map is provided in the middle of the webpage, where audience are enabled to search the address in a single webpage.
